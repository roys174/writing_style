# Writing Style
Code for classifying sentence according to their writing style. This is the code used for the style features classification in the following paper:

*The Effect of Different Writing Tasks on Linguistic Style: A Case Study of the ROC Story Cloze Task*

*Roy Schwartz, Maarten Sap, Yannis Konstas, Li Zilles, Yejin Choi and Noah A. Smith*, In proceedings of CoNLL 2017 ([pdf](https://arxiv.org/abs/1702.01841), [bib](http://homes.cs.washington.edu/~roysch/papers/language_constraint/language_constraint.bib))

### Requirements:

-- python2.7, with numpy, sklearn and spacy

-- perl5

### Running:

    1. pre_process.sh <ROC story dev file> <ROC story test file> <work directory = $PWD> <language model scores (dev set), optional> <language model scores (test set), optional>
	
-- This script generates files needed for training and testing. The files are stored in the input working directory.

-- The required arguments are the ROC story dev set and train set (see http://cs.rochester.edu/nlp/rocstories/).

-- Running the code without the last two arguments only uses the style classification features described in the paper (length, character n-grams and word n-grams).

-- In order to include the language model features described in the paper, two other arguments should be provided: the language model scores on the dev and test set. In order to generate those, a language model needs to be trained on the ROC story training set, and applied to the ROC story dev and test set. The code and instructions for doing this is found in the writing_style_lm submodule. 

    2. run_grid_search.PL <working directory>

-- This script runs grid search on the regularization parameter and returns results for experiment 1 and on the ROC story cloze task on train, dev and test set.

### Misc

-- The pre-processing step generates different train/dev splits each time, so results will vary between runs (and specifically different from the results published in the paper).
